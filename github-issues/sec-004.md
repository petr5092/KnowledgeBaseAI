## Problem
No health checks configured for any Docker services. Services can fail silently without detection.

**File:** `docker-compose.yml`

## Impact
- Undetected service failures
- No automatic recovery
- Cascading failures
- Prolonged outages

## Fix
Add health checks to all services:

```yaml
fastapi:
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8000/health"]
    interval: 30s
    timeout: 10s
    retries: 3
    start_period: 40s

postgres:
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U ${POSTGRES_USER}"]
    interval: 10s
    timeout: 5s
    retries: 5

redis:
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "redis-cli", "ping"]
    interval: 10s
    timeout: 5s
    retries: 3

neo4j:
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "wget", "--no-verbose", "--tries=1", "--spider", "http://localhost:7474"]
    interval: 10s
    timeout: 5s
    retries: 3

qdrant:
  healthcheck:
    test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:6333/health"]
    interval: 10s
    timeout: 5s
    retries: 3
```

Update depends_on to wait for healthy services:
```yaml
fastapi:
  depends_on:
    postgres:
      condition: service_healthy
    neo4j:
      condition: service_healthy
```

## Verification
```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker ps  # Should show health status
docker-compose ps  # Shows health in status column
```

## Estimated Time
2-3 hours
