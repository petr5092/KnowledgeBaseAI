## Problem
Neo4j driver lifecycle bug causes global driver instance to be closed unexpectedly, breaking subsequent requests.

**File:** `backend/app/services/graph/neo4j_repo.py` (lines 140-222)

**Current code:**
```python
def read_graph(...):
    drv = get_driver()  # Returns global _driver_instance
    # ... use driver ...
    drv.close()  # CLOSES GLOBAL INSTANCE!
    return nodes, edges
```

## Impact
- Connection failures after first request
- "Driver has been closed" errors
- Service degradation
- Requires container restart

## Fix
Remove individual `close()` calls and use proper lifecycle management:

```python
# In neo4j_repo.py - remove close() calls
def read_graph(...):
    driver = get_driver()
    with driver.session() as session:
        result = session.run(query)
        # Session auto-closes, driver stays open
    return result
```

```python
# In main.py - add shutdown handler
@app.on_event("shutdown")
async def shutdown_event():
    driver = get_driver()
    if driver:
        driver.close()
```

## Files to Update
- `backend/app/services/graph/neo4j_repo.py` (remove all `drv.close()` calls)
- `backend/app/main.py` (add shutdown handler)

## Testing
```bash
# Test multiple requests work
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl http://localhost:8000/v1/graph/viewport?center_uid=test&depth=1
done
# All should succeed
```

## Estimated Time
2 hours
