# Frontend development

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm

## Install

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

## Run dev server

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

If you run via Docker Compose, you can use the `frontend-dev` service.

## Runtime env

In production, the app reads `VITE_*` variables from `/env.js` (generated by the container).

For local development, you can either:

- run with defaults from `public/env.js`, or
- set `VITE_*` variables in your shell before starting Vite.

## Lint

```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint
```

## Build

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```
